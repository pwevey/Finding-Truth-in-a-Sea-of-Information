# Truth & Artificial Intelligence  
### A Christ-Centered Exploration of Technology

---

## About This Repository

This repository is a growing collection of Christian reflections on Artificial Intelligence, technology, and truth.

As Large Language Models and AI systems become increasingly persuasive and human-like, confusion grows about their nature, authority, and limits. This repository exists to clarify those distinctions through a biblical lens.

It seeks to answer questions such as:

- What are Large Language Models really doing?
- Do AI systems "think" or "understand"?
- Can statistical systems produce truth?
- How should Christians responsibly use AI?
- What is the difference between computation and consciousness?

## Core Conviction

Artificial Intelligence is a tool created by human beings.

Large Language Models are statistical pattern-prediction systems.  
They generate language through probabilistic mimicry.  
They do not think.  
They do not seek truth.  
They do not possess moral agency.  
They do not bear the image of God.

Truth is not grounded in probability.

For the Christian:

> "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life.'" — John 14:6

Truth is grounded in the character of God and revealed in Jesus Christ.

## Purpose

This repository aims to:

- Distinguish tool from being.
- Clarify prediction versus reality.
- Guard against confusion between simulation and soul.
- Provide theological and technical clarity regarding AI.
- Encourage responsible and disciplined use of technology.

It is not anti-technology.

It is pro-order.

## Repository Structure

```
/documents
    /human                — Human-authored theological and technical documents
    /ai-generated         — AI-generated documents with full disclosure
/docs                     — Static site deployed via GitHub Pages

### Human-Authored Documents

- [Finding Truth in a Sea of Information](documents/human/Finding%20Truth%20in%20a%20Sea%20of%20Information.md) — A Christian manifesto on Artificial Intelligence, by Paul Wever.

### AI-Generated Documents

The following documents were intentionally generated by Claude AI to demonstrate the nature and limits of language model output. Each contains a full disclosure header.

- [AI Reflection on the Nature of Truth](documents/ai-generated/ai-reflection-on-the-nature-of-truth.md) — Philosophical overview of truth and how LLMs function as next-token predictors.
- [Summary of a Christian Framework for Understanding AI](documents/ai-generated/summary-of-a-christian-framework-for-understanding-ai.md) — Synthetic summary of AI as a tool and truth grounded in God.

### Website

A minimal static site is available in the [`/docs`](docs/) folder and is deployed via GitHub Pages.

- [index.html](docs/index.html) — Home page with project introduction and document links.
- [about.html](docs/about.html) — About page explaining the project's purpose and methodology.

**Live site:** [https://truthandai.org/](https://truthandai.org/)

Each document may be updated over time.

## Why This Matters

AI systems increasingly shape:

- Communication
- Education
- Research
- Business
- Creative work
- Cultural influence

As their output becomes more convincing, it becomes more important to remember:

Prediction is not truth.  
Computation is not conscience.  
Simulation is not soul.

## Ongoing Commitment

This is a living repository.

Technology will change.  
Models will improve.  
Language will grow more sophisticated.

Christ does not change.

> "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." — Hebrews 13:8
