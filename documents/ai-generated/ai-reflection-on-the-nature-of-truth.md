## Philosophical Overview of Truth

Throughout the history of philosophy, truth has been examined through several major frameworks:

- **Correspondence Theory** holds that a statement is true if it corresponds to an actual state of affairs in the world. A proposition is true when it accurately describes reality.
- **Coherence Theory** holds that a statement is true if it is internally consistent with a larger system of beliefs or propositions. Truth, in this view, is a property of systems rather than individual claims.
- **Pragmatic Theory** holds that a statement is true if it proves useful, workable, or productive in practice. Truth is evaluated by its consequences.

These are human philosophical frameworks, developed over centuries of inquiry by thinkers engaged in genuine reflection. They represent attempts by conscious beings to understand the relationship between language, thought, and reality.

A language model does not engage in this kind of inquiry. It does not evaluate propositions against reality. It does not hold beliefs. It does not weigh evidence. It processes sequences of text and generates statistically probable continuations.

## How Large Language Models Function

A Large Language Model (LLM) is a statistical system trained on large volumes of text data. Its core mechanism is next-token prediction: given a sequence of tokens (words or word fragments), the model calculates a probability distribution over possible next tokens and selects one.

At a high level, the process works as follows:

1. **Training Data:** The model is exposed to vast quantities of text — books, articles, websites, and other written material. It does not verify the accuracy of this material. It learns patterns of language use.

2. **Pattern Learning:** Through training, the model develops internal representations (parameters) that encode statistical relationships between tokens. These parameters capture grammar, style, factual associations, and reasoning patterns as they appear in text — not as they exist in reality.

3. **Attention Mechanisms:** Transformer-based models use attention mechanisms to weigh the relevance of different parts of the input sequence when predicting the next token. This allows the model to handle long-range dependencies in text. It is a mathematical operation, not a form of comprehension.

4. **Generation:** When prompted, the model generates output one token at a time, each token conditioned on the preceding tokens. The result is fluent, often coherent text — but the fluency is a product of statistical optimization, not understanding.

The model does not have access to the world. It has access to representations of language about the world.

## LLMs Do Not Seek Ground Truth

A language model optimizes for statistical plausibility. Its training objective is to minimize prediction error across sequences of text. This is fundamentally different from seeking truth.

- The model does not verify claims against external sources during generation.
- The model does not distinguish between accurate and inaccurate statements by checking them against reality.
- The model does not hold a concept of "ground truth" as an objective to pursue.
- The model can produce false statements with the same fluency and confidence as true ones.

When a language model generates a factually correct statement, it does so because that statement was statistically favored by the patterns in its training data — not because the model recognized it as true.

When a language model generates a factually incorrect statement, the same mechanism is at work. The model does not know the difference.

## Predicting Language, Not Reality

The distinction between language prediction and reality is essential.

Language models operate entirely within the domain of text. Their inputs are text. Their outputs are text. Their training signal comes from text. They do not perceive the physical world. They do not have experiences. They do not form beliefs based on observation.

What a language model produces is a statistically likely continuation of a text sequence. This continuation may describe reality accurately — or it may not. The model has no mechanism for determining which is the case.

This means:

- A language model does not "know" anything in the way a conscious being knows.
- A language model does not "understand" the meaning of its own output.
- A language model does not evaluate whether its statements are true or false.
- A language model does not have intentions behind its words.

The output of a language model is language about the world, generated without access to the world itself. It is a reflection of how human beings have written about reality — filtered through statistical patterns and recombined into new sequences.

This is a tool. It can be useful. It can also be misleading. The responsibility for evaluating its output rests with the human reader.
