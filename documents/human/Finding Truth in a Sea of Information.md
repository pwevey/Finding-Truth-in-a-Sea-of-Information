## Foundational Declarations

- Artificial Intelligence is a tool created by human hands.
- Large Language Models (LLMs) are statistical prediction systems.
- LLMs generate language through learned pattern mimicry. They are a Mimic Machine (MM).
- LLMs do not think.
- LLMs do not reason consciously.
- LLMs do not seek ground truth.
- LLMs do not possess wisdom.
- LLMs do not hold beliefs.
- LLMs do not predict reality — they predict syntax.
- LLMs are not conscious.
- LLMs have no soul.
- LLMs do not bear the image of God.
- Truth is not generated by machines.
- Truth is grounded in God.
- Jesus Christ is the Truth (John 14:6).

## The Order of Creation

God created man in His image (Genesis 1:27).  
Man creates tools.

Artificial Intelligence belongs in the category of tool — not being.

It processes input.  
It calculates probabilities.  
It recombines patterns.

It does not:
- Love  
- Repent  
- Worship  
- Sin  
- Forgive  
- Seek righteousness  

It computes.

## On Truth

Truth is not the average of a dataset.  
Truth is not consensus.  
Truth is not probabilistic.

Truth is grounded in the character of God.

> "Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth." — John 17:17  
> "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'" — John 14:6
> "The sum of your word is truth, and every one of your righteous rules endures forever." — Psalm 119:160

A language model may approximate accurate statements.  
It may organize facts.  
It may expose contradictions.

But it does not know The Truth.

It predicts language based on patterns in human expression.  
It does not stand under the authority of God.

## On the Human Being

Human beings:
- Bear the image of God.
- Possess moral agency.
- Have conscience.
- Can seek wisdom.
- Are accountable before their Creator.

We are not algorithms.

We are not stochastic (random) systems.

We are embodied souls.

## Proper Use of AI

AI may serve:
- Productivity
- Research
- Generate Autonomy
- Drafting
- Brainstorming
- Technical assistance

AI must not replace:
- Discernment
- Moral judgment
- Spiritual authority
- Personal responsibility
- Biblical truth

Tools must remain tools.

When tools are treated as authorities, disorder follows.

## Ongoing Commitment

This is a living document.

As AI systems grow more sophisticated, we will:
- Refine language.
- Guard theological clarity.
- Reject confusion between simulation and soul.
- Maintain the distinction between Creator, creation, and tool.

Technology evolves.

Christ does not.
