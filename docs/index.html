      <p>
        This project is a growing collection of reflections on Artificial Intelligence,
        Large Language Models, and the nature of truth — examined through a Christian
        theological and technical lens.
      </p>
      <p>
        As AI systems become increasingly fluent and persuasive, clarity is needed about
        what these systems are, what they are not, and where truth is actually grounded.
        This repository provides that clarity.

        The documents listed below were generated by a Large Language Model (Claude AI).
        They are included intentionally to demonstrate the nature and limits of
        AI-produced text. Each document contains a full disclosure header. They are
        exhibits — not authorities.
