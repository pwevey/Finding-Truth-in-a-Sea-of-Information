      <p>My name is Paul Wever.</p>
      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineer by training and a QA engineer by profession. I work
        in CAD/CAM software, where precision, logic, and structured systems matter. My
        professional world is one of modeling, code, verification, and technical clarity.
      </p>
      <p>But I am also a Christian.</p>
      <p>This project exists at the intersection of those two realities.</p>

      <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
      <p>
        As Artificial Intelligence becomes more capable — and more persuasive — I have
        seen increasing confusion about what these systems are and what they are not.
        Language models can simulate reasoning, organize arguments, and produce coherent
        reflections. But they do not think. They do not possess moral agency. They do
        not seek truth.
      </p>
      <p>That distinction matters.</p>
      <p>
        This repository and website are my attempt to think clearly about AI through a
        biblical lens. Not fearfully. Not dismissively. But carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Technology is a tool.</li>
        <li>Tools must remain tools.</li>
        <li>Truth is not probabilistic.</li>
        <li>Truth is grounded in the character of God.</li>
        <li>Jesus Christ is the Truth (John 14:6).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Relationship with Technology</h2>
      <p>
        As someone who works directly with software systems, I am not anti-technology.
        I am deeply interested in it. I use AI tools in my own workflow. I experiment
        with them. I study how they function.
      </p>
      <p>But I reject the idea that computation equals consciousness.</p>

      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        This site is a growing archive of reflections on Artificial Intelligence,
        theology, philosophy, and technical reality. Some documents are written by me.
        Some are intentionally generated by AI systems and clearly labeled as such —
        not as authorities, but as demonstrations of statistical mimicry.
      </p>

      <h2>Clarity Requires Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        As AI advances, language will grow more convincing. The line between simulation
        and understanding will appear thinner. That is precisely why careful distinctions
        are necessary.
      </p>
      <p>Technology evolves.</p>
      <p>Christ does not.</p>
