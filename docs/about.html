      <p>My name is Paul Wever.</p>
      <p>
        I am a mechanical engineer by training and a QA engineer by profession. I work
        in CAD/CAM software, where precision, logic, and structured systems matter. My
        professional world is one of modeling, code, verification, and technical clarity.
      </p>
      <p>But I am also a Christian.</p>
      <p>This project exists at the intersection of those two realities.</p>

      <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
      <p>
        As Artificial Intelligence becomes more capable — and more persuasive — I have
        seen increasing confusion about what these systems are and what they are not.
        Language models can simulate reasoning, organize arguments, and produce coherent
        reflections. But they do not think. They do not possess moral agency. They do
        not seek truth.
      </p>
      <p>That distinction matters.</p>
      <p>
        This repository and website are my attempt to think clearly about AI through a
        biblical lens. Not fearfully. Not dismissively. But carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>What I Believe</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Technology is a tool.</li>
        <li>Tools must remain tools.</li>
        <li>Truth is not probabilistic.</li>
        <li>Truth is grounded in the character of God.</li>
        <li>Jesus Christ is the Truth (John 14:6).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>My Relationship with Technology</h2>
      <p>
        As someone who works directly with software systems, I am not anti-technology.
        I am deeply interested in it. I use AI tools in my own workflow. I experiment
        with them. I study how they function.
      </p>
      <p>But I reject the idea that computation equals consciousness.</p>

      <h2>About This Site</h2>
      <p>
        This site is a growing archive of reflections on Artificial Intelligence,
        theology, philosophy, and technical reality. Some documents are written by me.
        Some are intentionally generated by AI systems and clearly labeled as such —
        not as authorities, but as demonstrations of statistical mimicry.
      </p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This repository exists to provide theological and technical clarity regarding
        Artificial Intelligence — particularly Large Language Models.
      </p>
      <p>
        As AI-generated text becomes more fluent, more persuasive, and more widely
        distributed, it becomes increasingly important to understand what these systems
        actually are and what they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Large Language Models are statistical prediction systems. They generate language
        by predicting the next token in a sequence based on patterns learned from training
        data. They do not think. They do not reason consciously. They do not seek truth.
        They do not possess moral agency. They do not bear the image of God.
      </p>

      <h2>Why AI-Generated Documents Are Included</h2>
      <p>
        Some documents in this repository are intentionally generated by a Large Language
        Model (Claude AI). This is not an endorsement of AI-produced content as authoritative.
      </p>
      <p>
        These documents are included as demonstrations. They show what a language model
        produces when prompted on topics like truth, theology, and AI. They serve as
        exhibits — allowing the reader to observe firsthand the nature of machine-generated text.
      </p>
      <p>Each AI-generated document is clearly marked with:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The name of the model that generated it.</li>
        <li>The date of generation.</li>
        <li>A disclaimer stating that the content is statistical output and does not represent independent reasoning, theological authority, or conscious understanding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI as a Tool, Not an Authority</h2>
      <p>
        This project treats AI strictly as a tool. Tools can be useful for research,
        drafting, productivity, and technical assistance. But tools must remain tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI does not replace discernment. It does not replace moral judgment. It does not
        replace spiritual authority. It does not replace personal responsibility. It does
        not replace biblical truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The responsibility for evaluating any output — whether from a language model or
        any other source — rests with the human reader, who is made in the image of God,
        endowed with conscience, and accountable before the Creator.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Conviction</h2>
      <p>
        <em>"Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes
        to the Father except through me.'"</em> — John 14:6
      </p>
      <p>
        Truth is not probabilistic. Truth is not the average of a dataset. Truth is not
        consensus. Truth is grounded in the character of God and revealed in Jesus Christ.
      </p>

      <h2>Clarity Requires Discipline</h2>
      <p>
        As AI advances, language will grow more convincing. The line between simulation
        and understanding will appear thinner. That is precisely why careful distinctions
        are necessary.
      </p>
      <p>Technology evolves.</p>
      <p>Christ does not.</p>
