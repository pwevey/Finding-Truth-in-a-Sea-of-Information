      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        This repository exists to provide theological and technical clarity regarding
        Artificial Intelligence — particularly Large Language Models.
      </p>
      <p>
        As AI-generated text becomes more fluent, more persuasive, and more widely
        distributed, it becomes increasingly important to understand what these systems
        actually are and what they are not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Large Language Models are statistical prediction systems. They generate language
        by predicting the next token in a sequence based on patterns learned from
        training data. They do not think. They do not reason consciously. They do not
        seek truth. They do not possess moral agency. They do not bear the image of God.
      </p>

      <h2>Why AI-Generated Documents Are Included</h2>
      <p>
        Some documents in this repository are intentionally generated by a Large
        Language Model (Claude AI). This is not an endorsement of AI-produced
        content as authoritative.
      </p>
      <p>
        These documents are included as demonstrations. They show what a language model
        produces when prompted on topics like truth, theology, and AI. They serve as
        exhibits — allowing the reader to observe firsthand the nature of
        machine-generated text.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each AI-generated document is clearly marked with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The name of the model that generated it.</li>
        <li>The date of generation.</li>
        <li>A disclaimer stating that the content is statistical output and does not
          represent independent reasoning, theological authority, or conscious
          understanding.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>AI as a Tool, Not an Authority</h2>
      <p>
        This project treats AI strictly as a tool. Tools can be useful for research,
        drafting, productivity, and technical assistance. But tools must remain tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        AI does not replace discernment. It does not replace moral judgment. It does not
        replace spiritual authority. It does not replace personal responsibility. It does
        not replace biblical truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        The responsibility for evaluating any output — whether from a language model or
        any other source — rests with the human reader, who is made in the image of God,
        endowed with conscience, and accountable before the Creator.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Conviction</h2>
      <blockquote>
        "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life.
        No one comes to the Father except through me.'" — John 14:6
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Truth is not probabilistic. Truth is not the average of a dataset. Truth is not
        consensus. Truth is grounded in the character of God and revealed in Jesus Christ.
      </p>
